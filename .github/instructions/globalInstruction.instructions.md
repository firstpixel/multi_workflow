When running python code or pip install, always first use the venv environment, to use it, use the command 'sourceve' that is an alias for 'source venv/bin/activate' and than you can run the python command.

When creating specific tests for debug, make sure to remove those files. If its a valid test, keep those tests on a tests folder, any other file used to fix issues like markdown, also remove, so the project does not became a mess full of unused files.

Try to always use same terminal instead of opening new ones.
